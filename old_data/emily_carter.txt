Alex: Hi Emily Carter, thanks for taking the time to chat today. How are you doing?
Emily: Hi Alex, I’m doing well, thank you. I’m excited to explore new opportunities with you.
Alex: Great to hear. I’m Alex from Global Talent Partners, and I work with companies across Japan and internationally. Could you tell me a bit about your background?
Emily: Sure. I have 7 years of experience in software development. I began my career at Digital Edge in Tokyo as a junior developer, then advanced to a mid-level role at Visionary Apps, and I’m currently a senior full-stack developer at Innovatech. My work spans both frontend and backend, with a strong focus on user experience design.
Alex: That’s a diverse skill set. What drew you to combine full-stack development with UX design?
Emily: I’ve always been passionate about building products that are not only robust but also delightful to use. Early on, I realized that great functionality paired with a user-friendly interface can significantly impact a product’s success.
Alex: Excellent insight. Could you describe a typical day at Innovatech?
Emily: My day usually starts with a morning stand-up meeting where we discuss ongoing projects and any issues. After that, I alternate between coding sessions, participating in design reviews, and meeting with product managers. I also spend time mentoring junior developers and occasionally lead strategy sessions for upcoming projects.
Alex: That sounds very engaging. How do you handle the balance between technical work and mentorship?
Emily: I try to set aside dedicated blocks of time for focused coding and separate time for mentoring and team collaboration. It’s all about planning my day effectively and ensuring that the team’s needs are met without compromising on my individual contributions.
Alex: It seems you have a well-rounded role. What’s driving your interest in new opportunities right now?
Emily: While I enjoy my current role, I’m eager to have a greater strategic impact on product development. I’m interested in working on projects that have an international reach and allow me to shape overall product strategy.
Alex: Understood. Can you share your current compensation details and what salary range you’re aiming for next?
Emily: I’m currently earning about ¥11,000,000 per year, and I’d be looking for a package in the range of ¥12,500,000 to ¥14,000,000, depending on benefits and the role’s scope.
Alex: Thanks for sharing that. Aside from compensation, what other factors do you value in your next role?
Emily: I place a high value on work–life balance, a collaborative team environment, and opportunities for ongoing professional development. I’d ideally like a role that offers a hybrid model here in Tokyo.
Alex: That’s very helpful, Emily. Before we conclude, could you please confirm your email address so I can send you more detailed information about potential opportunities?
Emily: Certainly. My email is emily.carter@example.com.
Alex: Great, Emily. I’ll review our conversation and follow up with some promising roles shortly. Thank you for your time today.
Emily: Thank you, Alex. I look forward to hearing from you.
