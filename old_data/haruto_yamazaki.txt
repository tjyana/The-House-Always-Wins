Alex: Hi Haruto Yamazaki, thanks for connecting and taking the time to chat today. How are you doing?
Haruto: Hi Alex, I’m doing well, thank you. I appreciate you reaching out—I’m excited to discuss potential opportunities.
Alex: Great to hear. I’m Alex from Global Talent Partners. We work with a range of innovative companies here in Japan and internationally. Could you start by sharing a bit about your background?
Haruto: Sure. I’ve been in software development for about 9 years. I started as a junior developer at Nippon Tech in Osaka, then moved into a mid-level role at Global Systems, and now I’m a senior developer at Innovative Solutions in Tokyo. My focus is mainly on backend development and designing cloud architectures.
Alex: That’s an impressive trajectory. What initially drew you to backend development and cloud technologies?
Haruto: Early on, I was fascinated by the challenge of building systems that could handle large-scale data and traffic. As cloud technologies emerged, I saw their potential to revolutionize the way applications scale and operate. It was a natural fit for my interests in efficiency and robust design.
Alex: Excellent. Could you walk me through what a typical day looks like at Innovative Solutions?
Haruto: Absolutely. My day starts with a team stand-up where we discuss progress and any roadblocks. Then I spend a good part of the morning designing system architectures and planning our cloud deployments. In the afternoon, I dive into coding, reviewing pull requests, and coordinating with product managers and our overseas colleagues. I also set aside time for mentoring some of our junior engineers.
Alex: It sounds like you have a very structured day. How do you manage the challenges of coordinating with international teams?
Haruto: Communication is key. We use a mix of scheduled overlapping hours and collaboration tools like Slack and Zoom. I try to ensure that everyone’s on the same page by documenting our processes and maintaining clear channels for feedback.
Alex: That makes sense. In terms of project challenges, could you describe one recent project where you had to overcome significant technical hurdles?
Haruto: Certainly. We recently migrated a legacy system to a cloud-native architecture. The challenge was ensuring zero downtime while transferring critical data. We broke the process into phases and implemented extensive testing at each stage. The project took coordination across multiple teams and time zones, but in the end, we successfully improved system performance by 40%.
Alex: That’s a notable achievement. With that level of responsibility, what’s motivating you to explore new opportunities now?
Haruto: While I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished at Innovative Solutions, I’m eager to step into a role with more strategic influence—ideally where I can shape product direction on an even larger scale and work on projects with an international footprint.
Alex: Understood. Let’s talk practicalities. Could you share your current compensation and your salary expectations for your next move?
Haruto: I’m currently earning about ¥12,500,000 per year. For my next role, I’d be targeting a range between ¥14,000,000 and ¥15,500,000, depending on the overall benefits and responsibilities.
Alex: That’s clear, thanks. Apart from salary, what other factors are important to you?
Haruto: I’m based in Tokyo, so I’d prefer roles here or with a good hybrid model. I also value a culture that emphasizes continuous learning and innovation. Good work–life balance and professional growth are high on my list.
Alex: Excellent. Before we wrap up, I’d like to confirm your email address so I can send you more detailed information about next steps.
Haruto: Sure thing. My email is haruto.yamazaki@example.jp.
Alex: Perfect. I’ll review our discussion and be in touch soon with some potential matches. Thank you again for your time, Haruto.
Haruto: Thank you, Alex. I appreciate the conversation and look forward to hearing from you.
