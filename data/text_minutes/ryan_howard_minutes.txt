Recruiter: Hi Ryan Howard, thanks for joining our call today. How are you doing?

Ryan Howard: Hi, I’m doing well, thank you. I appreciate you reaching out and setting up this conversation.

Recruiter: Great to hear. Let’s start with your background. I see you earned your Bachelor of Science in Marketing from Metro Business School in 2004. Can you share what initially drew you to digital marketing and how your education influenced your career?

Ryan Howard: Absolutely. I was always intrigued by the power of digital channels to transform brand engagement. My time at Metro Business School provided a strong foundation in marketing principles and consumer behavior, which naturally led me to explore the digital side of things as the internet began to reshape the industry.

Recruiter: That’s fascinating. Your career started at MarketMetrics Inc. as a Junior Digital Marketer from 2004 to 2008. Could you walk me through your role there and some of the early challenges you encountered?

Ryan Howard: Sure. At MarketMetrics, I assisted in launching online advertising campaigns, coordinated with creative teams to produce engaging digital content, and generated performance reports. One of the early challenges was understanding how to measure digital performance accurately, which meant diving deep into data analytics and learning how to adjust campaigns based on real-time feedback.

Recruiter: It sounds like that role provided you with a solid foundation in the digital space. You then moved to AdVision Corp. as a Digital Marketing Manager from 2008 to 2013. How did your responsibilities evolve in that role?

Ryan Howard: At AdVision, my role expanded significantly. I developed multi-channel marketing strategies that increased our web traffic by 35%, oversaw SEO, SEM, and email campaigns, and analyzed campaign data to optimize marketing spend and ROI. The transition from a junior role to managing entire campaigns was both challenging and exciting. I learned a lot about strategic planning, team management, and the importance of aligning marketing initiatives with broader business objectives.

Recruiter: That’s impressive growth. Can you share a specific example from your time at AdVision where you had to pivot your strategy due to market changes?

Ryan Howard: Certainly. There was a period when our traditional marketing channels began to underperform due to increased competition. I led my team in reassessing our strategy and quickly pivoted to a more data-driven approach. We increased our focus on content marketing and social media engagement, which not only helped us regain lost ground but also boosted our overall online presence. It was a challenging time, but it taught us the value of agility in marketing.

Recruiter: It sounds like you were able to turn a challenge into an opportunity, which is a valuable skill in digital marketing. Now, you’re currently at Pulse Media as a Senior Digital Marketing Strategist since 2013. Could you describe your current role and the key projects you’ve been involved with?

Ryan Howard: At Pulse Media, I craft comprehensive digital strategies that have boosted online engagement by 40%. I lead cross-functional teams to execute innovative social media campaigns and implement data-driven processes to refine our marketing initiatives. One of the standout projects was a complete overhaul of our social media strategy, which involved integrating advanced analytics tools and testing various creative approaches until we found the optimal mix. This project significantly increased our audience reach and conversion rates.

Recruiter: That’s an outstanding achievement. With such a diverse range of responsibilities, how do you ensure your strategies remain innovative and ahead of market trends?

Ryan Howard: I place a strong emphasis on continuous learning. I keep up with the latest trends by attending industry conferences, participating in webinars, and engaging with thought leaders in digital marketing. I also foster a culture of experimentation within my team, where we test new ideas on a small scale before rolling them out broadly. This approach allows us to remain agile and innovative.

Recruiter: It’s great to see that you’re committed to staying ahead of the curve. In addition to your technical and strategic skills, how have you developed your leadership abilities over the years?

Ryan Howard: Leading teams in the fast-paced world of digital marketing has definitely sharpened my leadership skills. I believe in clear communication and setting measurable goals. I also prioritize mentorship by regularly holding one-on-one sessions with team members and encouraging an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas. This collaborative approach has helped us consistently deliver high-quality results.

Recruiter: Your leadership style sounds very effective. Can you tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict within your team or adapt to a significant change in strategy?

Ryan Howard: One instance that stands out was when there was a major disagreement about the direction of one of our campaigns. Different team members had conflicting opinions on whether to invest in a new digital platform. I organized a series of strategy sessions where everyone could present their viewpoints backed by data. By facilitating a structured discussion, we were able to reach a consensus that balanced risk with potential reward, and the campaign ended up exceeding our expectations.

Recruiter: That’s a great example of effective conflict resolution and collaborative problem-solving. Looking ahead, what are your long-term career goals, and what kind of opportunities are you seeking?

Ryan Howard: I’m interested in roles that allow me to further drive digital transformation and lead larger, more complex marketing initiatives. I’d love the opportunity to work in an environment where I can have a significant strategic impact on the company’s digital direction. Essentially, I’m looking for a role that challenges me to innovate and grow both personally and professionally.

Recruiter: That’s very insightful, Ryan. Based on our conversation and your impressive track record, I believe there might be a specific position at our company that aligns perfectly with your aspirations. We’re currently developing a new role that focuses on steering our digital strategy across multiple channels and managing a larger team. I’d like to pitch this opportunity to you in a follow-up meeting, where we can go into more detail about the position, the company’s vision, and how your skills could be a perfect match.

Ryan Howard: That sounds intriguing. I’m definitely open to hearing more about the opportunity, especially if it involves a larger strategic role and broader team leadership.

Recruiter: Excellent. For our follow-up, I’ll prepare a detailed overview of the position, including the key responsibilities, the team structure, and the strategic goals for the role. We can discuss how your experience at Pulse Media and your earlier roles would add tremendous value to this new initiative.
